### How to modify & install theme for Telegram Desktop

There's an [official guide](http://telegra.ph/Create-Telegram-Theme-01-12) how to make themes (and also an unofficial [Russian version](http://telegra.ph/Telegram-Desktop-Rukovodstvo-po-temam-01-12) of the guide)

1) Edit colors.tdesktop-theme file.  
2) Change background (if you want). Tiled backgrounds should be named `tiled.png` or `tiled.jpg` while normal backgrounds should be names as `background.png` or `background.jpg`.  
3) Pack both files into zip-archive and rename it as `YOUR-THEME.tdesktop-theme` (watch the extension!).  
4) Send it to any chat in Telegram Desktop, then download, click and apply!  
5) If you want to revert to default theme, click `Use default color theme` button in settings.
